Introduction
==

Eturia is a computer for education. It is designed to be simple and limited in its interface, much like the classic education computers of yore like the Apple IIe and the original Macintosh, but not in its capabilities. It is anompanied by a book titled The Order of Symbols, a course and tutorial on the language Sigil that runs in Eturia.

Sigil is a type of programming language known as a Lisp which was created (or found) in the 1950's by John McCarthy. It has a simple syntax that is easy for to learn for beginners and to type in correctly. It is powerful, in that although it starts out simple, it is a tool that is itself programmable in itself. As the book goes along, we build a language on top of Sigil using Sigil itself.

Currently, Eturia is implemented as a computer program inside of a web browser and can be found at the following URL:

Currently, the client is browser only and requires no backend to operate other than a simple web server. But, there are future plans for a communication infrastructure using an innovative back end technology known as Urbit. The first communication technology to the system is going to be some sort of chat program so that users of Eturia will be able to interact with each other and form a community. Future additions also include the ability to load, save and collaborate cores (programs) with other users, and the ability to turn the network of Eturia users into a large, collaborative, distributed network computing grid.
