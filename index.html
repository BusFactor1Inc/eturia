        The Eturia project, a browser based Personal Computer designed to be free for all to use (and program) on the Internet, is starting to reach maturity and move to the later embryonic stage. It is being livecoded at Livecoding.tv, has some new documentation, and plan of a possible future educational YouTube channel teaching it's use and programming from the ground up.<p/>
        
        Eturia is meant to be a tool for beginners to experts learn the design and development of programming languages with very little programming knowledge required to start with the 'course'.<p/>
