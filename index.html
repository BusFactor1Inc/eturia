            <h3>What is Eturia</h3>
            
            Eturia is a computer for education.  It is designed to be
            simple and limited in its interface, much like the classic
            education computers of yore like the <b>Apple IIe</b> and the
            original <b>Macintosh</b>, but not in its capabilities.  It is
            anompanied by a book titled <b>The Order of Symbols</b>, a
            course and tutorial on the language <b>Sigil</b> that runs in
            Eturia.<p/>
            
            Sigil is a type of programming language known as a <b>Lisp</b>
            which was created (or found) in the <b>1950's</b> by John
            McCarthy.  It has a simple syntax that is easy for to
            learn for beginners and to type in correctly.  It is
            powerful, in that although it starts out simple, it is a
            tool that is itself <b>programmable</b> in itself.  As the book
            goes along, we build a <b>language</b> on top of Sigil using
            Sigil itself.<p/>
            
            Currently, Eturia is implemented as a computer program
            inside of a web browser and can be found at the following
            URL:<p/>
            
            
            <a href=http://busfactor1.ca/bin/eturia/client/dev.html>
              http://busfactor1.ca/bin/eturia/client/dev.html</a><p/>
            
            Currently, the client is browser only and requires no
            backend to operate other than a simple web server.  But,
            there are future plans for a communication infrastructure
            using an innovative back end technology known as Urbit.
            The first communication technology to the system is going
            to be some sort of <b>chat</b> program so that users of
            Eturia will be able to interact with each other and form a
            community. Future additions also include the ability to
            load, save and collaborate cores (programs) with other
            users, and the ability to turn the network of Eturia users
            into a large, collaborative, distributed network computing
            grid.<p/>
