Introduction
------------

Lisp as a computer programming language is as Latin is to English or
modern day Italian.  It is the second oldest high level computer
language still in use, invented (or found) in the 1950's by John
McCarthy and is the most powerful and expressive programming language
there is [citation needed].  Lisp comes in many shapes and forms and
Sigil, the Lisp used in Eturia, is no different.  It is a 'dialect' of
Lisp, as Lisp is more of an idea than a concrete thing, with all
dialects looking similar, but behaving, sometimes, very differently.
And like any dialect of a language, it is malleable and modifiable,
something which I will show you though this document as we build our
language from base principals (axioms).

The following is meant to be both an introduction and reference to
Sigil.  You will find an explanation of syntax, followed by a brief
explanation of Eturia, the Listener and Window Manager, followed by
the list of builtins, and then a set of examples that can be followed
along and typed into the Eturia Listener, which can be found at:

This paper is intended to follow the ideas of Guy Steele in his
talk/paper 'Growing a language':

This material is the result of many years of study and research, of
both myself and others.  It's opinions are all mine, built apon
those I have admired in the past, knowingly or unknowningly. I hope
you find the material as useful and entertaining as I have writing it
down and preparing it.

Intended Audience
-----------------

This work is intended for both beginners and professionals alike.  For
beginners, if they work through the exercies, should gain an
understanding for all of the code and exercises given, with a little
thought.  Professionals may benefit in the same way, finding the
material refreshing over the typical code chaos one might see at work,
while learning something new and, hopefully, interesting: programming
language design and implementation.

The main desire of the reader should be to learn to program.  This is
not a traditional programming course in any way and will teach you
little on how to get a job as a programmer.  But knowing what this
course will teach you will benefit you for as long as you act as a
programmer during your life [citation needed].

This course assumes a basic understanding of arithmetic and algebra,
along with the idea that a computer is something that simply follows
the instructions that they are told, nothing more.  As Picasso
noted, "Computers...they can only give you answers."


Eturia
------

Eturia is a (similated) computer for Computer Science Education.  It
is designed to be simple and limited, perfect for teaching and
learning with few distractions.  Although probably unfamiliar at
first, it's spartan interface can be quickly learned by any newcomer
with its few and simple commands. Finally, it runs in a Web browser,
so it is accessable from any location with an internet connection.

The current version of Eturia can always be found at:

    http://busfactor1.ca/bin/eturia

along with videos and other information about the project.


The Listener
------------

There is no copy/pasting in Eturia.  To enter the code, it must be
typed manually into the 'Listener'.  This way the code will go through
your fingers and your brain, giving you a better chance of learning
the concepts as you go along and build your own language in Sigil.

This 'Listener' is like Like VI, but a bit different[1]:

i - insert mode, allows you to type overwrite text in the buffer
? - command mode, allows you to execute the following commands
    and break out of insert mode
hjkl - move the cursor left, down, up, or right (h,j,k,l)
e - evaluate lisp code
z - clear the screen
np - previous/next in history (experimental)

To type characters use 'insert' (overwrite) mode by pressing 'i'. You
can tell when you are in 'insert' mode by the GREEN border around the
console.  To 'escape' out of insert mode, press '?'.

REMEMBER TO CLICK IN THE WINDOW TITLE BEFORE TRYING TO TYPE IN THE
LISTENER.

[1] VI and Emacs are programmers text editors.  There has been a
decades long debate over the merits and benfits of using each.  Emacs
is a modern day Lisp Machine, VI is akin to a Unix machine.  I chose a
VI-like editor interface for Eturia due to the simplicity of
implementing it.

Window Manager
--------------

    - click in title bar to focus window
    - click and drag in title bar to move window
    - middle click in title bar to remove window

======
Syntax
======

The following is the syntax of Sigil:

Numbers - a string of digits
----------------------------

A number can be used with mathematical functions and should be
familiar to all that have taken introductory mathmatics.

Examples:

    1 is a number
    100 is a number
    3.141516 is a number
    -3 is a number


Symbol - a string of characters
-------------------------------

A symbol is a string of characters not containing '(', or ')'.

Examples:

    x is a symbol
    abc is a symbol
    x123 is a symbol
    123x is a symbol
    a-longer-symbol is a symbol
    |a symbol with spaces| is a symbol


Comments - a note to your self
------------------------------

Comments can be important in programs as they are used to explain the
purpose of the code you are writing.

Examples:

    ; this is a comment


Quoting - stops evaluation
--------------------------

Evaluation means to 'get the value of something'.  Sometimes you want
this to not happen and just get 'something'.  Quoting is used for that
and is an essential part of the following examples.

Examples:
1 => 1
`1 => 1
x => ; Error, undefined symbol
`x => x
(1 2 3) => ; Error, undefined function: 1
`(1 2 3) => (1 2 3)


List - build lists
------------------

Besides 'atoms' (numbers and symbols), Sigil also has 'lists'.  A list
is a collection of atoms or other lists, also known as an
'S-expression' for historical reasons.

Examples:

    `() => (); the empty list
    `(1) => (1) ; a 'proper' list containing the digit 1
    `(1 . ()) => (1) ; a 'proper' list containing the digit 1
    `(1 2 3) => (1 2 3) ; is a 'proper' list of the digits 1 2 3
    `(1 2 3 . ()) => (1 2 3) ; is a 'proper' list of the digits 1 2 3
    `(1 . 2) => (1 . 2) ; is an 'improper' list of the digits 1 and 2
    `(x . y) => (x . y) ; is an 'improper' list of the symbols x and y
    `(1 2 . (3 . (4 . ()))) => (1 2 3 4)

A proper list has () as its last element, and it is not normally
shown.  An improper list does not have () as it's last element, and
this is shown by preceeding the last element with a dot.

Note: even the code in Sigil is lists.  This is a very iportant
concept to remember, as Sigil is all about building and generating
code using the functions we are going to be defining in the following
chapters.


Comma ',' - evaulate inside of a quote
---------------------------------------

Sometimes you want to quote a list, but also want to include the
values of other symbols inside of it.  To perform this action, you use
the comma operator inside of a quoted list.

Examples:

    (set `x 1) => 1
    x => 1
    `(x 2 3) => (x 2 3)
    `(,x 2 3) => (1 2 3)


Commaat ',@' - evaluate a list inside of a quote, and splice it
----------------------------------------------------------------

Other times when building code, you want to embed the contents of a
list inside of a quoted list.  This is done with the commaat (,@)
operator inside of a quoted list.

Examples:

    (set `x `(a b c))
    x => (a b c)
    `(x 1 2 3) => (x 1 2 3)
    `(,x 1 2 3) => ((a b c) 1 2 3)
    `(,@x 1 2 3) => (a b c 1 2 3)
    `(1 2 3 ,x) => (1 2 3 (a b c))
    `(1 2 3 ,@x) => (1 2 3 a b c)
    `(1 2 3 . ,@x) => ; error, no splicing after a dot


NOTE: SYMBOLS AND NUMBERS ARE ALSO KNOWN AS ATOMS.

 -------------------------------------------------
| Booleans - () is false, everything else is true |
 -------------------------------------------------

As in most languages, Sigil has the idea of booleans, true and false.
In this case, the empty list, () is 'false' and everything else is
'true'.  A special symbol 't' is defined to represent truth when
needed, but is not required to be used.

Functions that are meant to return either a true or false value are
known as 'predicates'.

Builtins
========

The following are the builtin commands for Sigil.  A builtin is a
function that is available by default in the language and is always
available.

Note: in the Examples, '=>' means 'evaulates to' or 'the value of'.


0) quote, unquote, unquote-splice - control evaluation
------------------------------------------------------

Rather than use the shorthands described above, you can also call
'quote', 'unquote' and 'unquote-splice' directly to build lists and
control evalutation within a quoted list.

Examples:

    1 => 1 ; 'give me the value of' 1
    (quote 1) => 1 ; 'give me' 1
    x => ; 'give me the value of' x, error, as x has no value
    (quote x) => x ; 'give me' x
    (quote (1 2 3)) => (1 2 3) ; give me the list of digits 1, 2 and 3

    ;; longhand evaluation with ',' and splicing with ',@'
    (set (quote x) 1) => 1 ; give x the value 1
    (quote ((unquote x) 2 3) => (1 2 3) ; evaluate inside of quoted list as with ','
    (quote ((unquote-splice x) 2 3) => ; error, cannot unquote-splice a non-list
    (set (quote x) (quote (1 2 3))) => (1 2 3) ; give x a value that is a list
    (quote ((quote x) 2 3)) => ((1 2 3) 2 3) ; unquote x with as with ','
    (quote ((unquote-splice x) 2 3)) => (1 2 3 2 3) ; splice the list as with ',@'

Normally you would use the shorthands.


1) atom - a predicate to test if its argument is an atom
--------------------------------------------------------

Everything in Sigil is either an atom (symbol, number, or ()) or a
list.

Examples:

    (atom t) => t
    (atom ()) => t
    (atom `x) => t
    (atom 1) => t
    (atom `(1 2 3)) => ()

2) eq - equality
----------------

Atoms can be tested for equality using 'eq'.

Examples:

    (eq t t) => t
    (eq () ()) => t
    (eq t ()) => ()
    (eq `x `x) => t
    (eq `x `y) => ()
    (eq 1 1) => t
    (eq 1 2) => ()
    (eq `(1 2 3) `(1 2 3)) => () ; notice! see 'equal', below.

3) cons - create a new list cell
--------------------------------

A cons cell is a 2 element cell that has a head slot and an a tail
slot.  The 'cons' function allocates one of these cells and assigns
the first argument to the head slot and the second argument to the
tail slot.

Examples:

    (cons 1 ()) => (1) ; build a proper list with () at the tail
    (cons `x ()) => (x) ; build another proper list
    (cons () ()) => (()) ; again, but with () at the head
    (cons `x `y) => (x . y) ; notice! an improper list
    (cons 1 2) => (1 . 2) ; and again
    (cons (1 (cons 2 ()))) => (1 2) ; making a proper list

4) car - return the first element of a list
-------------------------------------------

Take a list and return the head slot of its first cell.

Examples:

    (car `(1 2 3)) => 1
    (car `((1 2 3) 2 3)) => (1 2 3)
    (car ()) => ()
    (car `x) => ; Error
    (car 1) => ; Error

5) cdr - return everything but the first element of a list
----------------------------------------------------------

Take a list and return the tail slot of its first cell.

Examples:

    (cdr `(1 2 3)) => (2 3)
    (cdr `((1 2 3) 2 3)) => (2 3)
    (cdr ()) => ()
    (cdr `x) => ; Error
    (cdr 1) => ; Error

6) cond - conditional statement, execute tests until one returns not (),
          and then execute the following statement
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cond is used to make decisions on what statements to execute.  It goes
through it's arguments, excuting the each test, the first element of
the argument, until one of them returns not (), after which it then
excutes the statements following the test and returns the value of the
last one.  You will often set 't' as the last test in a cond, meaning
to always excute that set of statements if none of the previous tests
pass.

Examples:

    (cond (t 1)) => 1
    (cond (() 1)) => ()
    (cond ((t 1) (t 2))) => 1
    (cond ((() 1) (t 2))) => 2
    (cond ((() 1) (() 2) (t 3))) => 3
    (cond ((() 1) (t 2) (t 3))) => 2
    (set `x ())
    (set `y t)
    (cond
      (x `shouldnt-get-here)
      (y `should-get-here)
      (t `wont-get-here)) => should-get-here

7) set - assign a symbol a value (variables)
--------------------------------------------

Sometimes it is convenient to create a shortcut to certain values,
known as a variable. 'set' can be used to create or change the values
of symbols in the variable namespace.

Examples:

    (set `x 1) => 1 ; set single values
    x => 1
    (set `x 2) => 2
    x => 2
    (set `x `(1 2 3)) => (1 2 3)
    x => (1 2 3)
    (set `x 1 `y 2 `z 3) => 3 ; set multiple values at once

8) lambda - create a function
-----------------------------

A function is a set of bound variables and a series of statements,
known as the body, that can be 'called', which assigns values to the
variables and executes the statements of the body sequentially, until
the value of the last evaluated expression is returned.

Examples:

    (lambda (x) x) => (lambda (x) x)
    ((lambda (x) x) 1) => 1 ; call the function immediately
    (set `x 1) => 1
    ((lambda (x) (+ x x)) 2) => 4 ; x is bound to 2 during the call
    x => 1 ; the value of x was not changed by calling the function
    ((lambda (x) (set x 2))) ; set x in the function
    x => 1 ; the value of x is still unchanged
    ((lambda (x y) (* x y)) 2 3) => 6 ; x is bound to 2, y is bound to 3
    (set `double (lambda (x) (+ x x))) => ... ; declare a named function
    (double 2) => 4 ; call declared function

We use the keyword 'lambda' to declare functions because of Lisp's
close ties to what is known as the "Lambda Calculus", discovered by
Alonzo Church in the 1930's.


9) self - the current function that is executing, used for recursion
---------------------------------------------------------------------

"To iterate is human, to recurse divine."
  -- L. Peter Deutsch

Recursion is a fundamental concept used for looping, or doing
something more than once in Sigil.  To count the number of elements in
a list, one can break the problem into counting the first element of
the list, which is always 1, and adding that to the number of elements
in the rest of the list.  This can be done in a function by calling
itself, or recursing, with the rest of the list until the empty list
is found, meaning we are done and can return the computed length by
adding all of the 1's together.

Examples:

    ((lambda (l n) ; return the length of a list, recursively
       (cond
         ((cdr l)  ; if there are still elements in the list
          (self (cdr l) (+ 1 n))) ; recurse with the tail of the list,
                                  ; and increment accumulator
         (t ; there are no elements left in the list
          n))) ; return accumulator
      `(a b c) 0) => 3 

    ((lambda (l) ; return the last element of the list, recursively
       (cond
         ((null (cdr l)) ; if the next element is ()
          (car l)) ; return the head of the list
         (t ; the next element is not ()
           (self (cdr l))))) ; recurse down the list
     `(1 2 3)) => 3

Recursion may be confusing at first.  It is highly reccomended you
take the time to step through the above examples so you can gain a
solid understanding of recursion and how it works.


10) apply - call a function with a list of arguments
----------------------------------------------------

Sometimes you want to call a function with a prepared list of
arguments.  The reason for this will become more apparent later as we
work through the examples and projects.

Examples:

    (apply (lambda (x) (+ x x)) `(1)) => 2
    (apply (lambda (x y z) (+ x y z)) `(1 2 3)) => 6
    (apply double `(2)) => 4 ; using previously defined function in 9)

11) values - return multiple values from a function
---------------------------------------------------

For when you want to return more than one value from a function.
Notice how the multiple values are printed after evaulating a function
returning them in the listener.

Examples:

    (values 1) => 1
    (values 1 2) => 1
    2
    ((lambda (x) (values x)) 1) => 1
    ((lambda (x y) (values x y)) 1 2) => 1
    2


12) bind - bind multiple values to symbols
------------------------------------------

When a function returns more than one value, you can 'bind' the
returned values to variables and excute the statements in the body
using these bindings.

Examples:

    (set `multiple-values (lambda (x y) (values x y))) => ...
    (bind (a b) (multiple-values 1 2) (cons a b)) => (1 . 2)


13) defmacro - define a macro
-----------------------------

Macros are functions that return code that is executed immediately
after.  This is in contrary to regular functions that can return
anything. Using macros we can build the our language from the
primitives described in this section.

Macros are a powerful tool that give Lisp it's power and are the
reason for its form.  There are many examples that follow that use
defmacro, so study them carefully to understand it's use.


14) + - addition, sum
---------------------

Mathematical addition, or sum with more than 2 arguments.  Also used
to concatenate symbols.

Examples:

    (+ 1 2) => 3 ; arithmeical addition of numbers
    (+ 1 2 3) => 6 ; sum of multiple numbers
    (+ `x `y) => xy ; concatenation of symbols


15) - - subtraction, difference
-------------------------------

Mathematical subtraction, or difference with more than 2 arguments.

    (- 1 2) => -1 ; arithmetical subtraction
    (- 1 2 3) => -4 ; difference of multiple numbers


16) * - multiply, product
-------------------------

Mathematical multiply, or product with more than 2 arguments.

    (* 1 2) => 2 ; arithmetical multiplication
    (* 1 2 3) => 6 ; product of multiple numbers


17) / - divide, quotient
------------------------

Mathematical divide, or quotient with more than 2 arguments.

Examples: 

    (/ 1 2) => .5 ; arithmetical division
    (/ 1 2 3) => 0.1666... ; quotient of multiple numbers


18) % - remainder, mod
----------------------

Mathematical remainder, or 'mod'.

Examples:

    (% 5 2) => 1 ; 1 is the remainder of dividing 5 by 2


19) env - return the current environment

Variables are defined in the 'variable namespace'.  env is used to
return this namespace for inspection and modification.  If env is
called with an argument, it will set the current 'variable namespace'
to the argument given.

Examples:

     (env) => ((t . t) ...) ; return the current environment
     (env (env)) => ... ; set the current environment


20) fenv - return the current function environment

Functions are defined in the 'function namespace'.  fenv is used to
return this namespace for inspection and modification.  If fenv is
called with an argument, it will set the current 'variable namespace'
to the argument given.

Examples:

    (fenv) => ((set . builtin) (cons . builtin) ...)
    (fenv (fenv)) => ... ; set the current function environment


21) save - save the current environments
----------------------------------------

The environment where you store your variables and macros can be saved
to local storage in your browser using the 'save' command.

(save) => ; default /core is saved
(save /backup) => ; saved to /backup in local storage


22) load - load a core into the current environment

The environment can be loaded from local storage using the 'load' command.

THIS FEATURE IS CURRENTLY NOT IMPLMENTED.


23) me - macro expand
---------------------

Expand macros in the code given as an argument.  Helpful for
debugging.

Examples:

    (defmacro cadr (l) `(car (cdr ,l)) ; define the macro cadr
    (me (cadr `(1 2 3))) => (car (cdr `(1 2 3))) ; expand it


24) eval - evaluate an expression
---------------------------------

Sometimes you have a code in a form that you wish to evaluate.  You
can do this by calling eval.

Examples:

    `(+ 1 2) => (+ 1 2) ; unevaluated code
    (eval `(+ 1 2)) => 3 ; calling eval on it gives the result

25) => - evaluate JavaScript code
---------------------------------

Used to execute JavaScript code that can be built by concatenating symbols.

Examples:

    (=> |1 + 1|) => 2
    (=> |console.log("Testing")|) => ; prints Testing in the JavaScript console

This builtin allows for the interaction between Sigil and the
underlying web browser. It is an advanced operation that will be used
to build Eturia as a Lisp Machine from within Sigil itself.  Eturia is
written in JavaScript, but the goal of the system is to modify the
JavaScript code as little as possible from outside of it.

The following exercies build upon the primitive builtins defined
previously and are meant to be typed into the Eturia 'Listener'
console.  The 'Examples' can be used as test cases to ensure the
correctness of your inputs.

0) first, second, third, rest, ... - shortcuts
----------------------------------------------

These first code examples show the most basic of macro, the shortcut.

(defmacro first (x)
  `(car ,x))

(defmacro second (x)
  `(car (cdr ,x)))

(defmacro third (x)
  `(car (cdr (cdr ,x))))

(defmacro rest (x)
  `(cdr ,x))

(defmacro caar (x)
  `(car (car ,x)))

(defmacro cadr (x) ; same a second
  `(car (cdr ,x)))

(defmacro cdar (x)
  `(cdr (car ,x)))

(defmacro cddr (x)
  `(cdr (cdr ,x)))

As you can see, the above macros return non-evaluated 'code'.  This
'code' is then executed immediately after the macro is called with
arguments, as the following examples show.

Examples:

    (first `(1 2 3)) => 1 ; expands to (car `(1 2 3))
    (me (first `(1 2 3))) => (car `(1 2 3))
    (second `(1 2 3)) => 2 ; expands to (car (cdr `(1 2 3)))
    (me (second `(1 2 3))) => (car (cdr `(1 2 3)))
    (third `(1 2 3)) => 3 ; expands to (car (cdr (cdr `(1 2 3))))
    (me (third `(1 2 3))) => (car (cdr (cdr `(1 2 3))))
    (rest `(1 2 3)) => (2 3) ; expands to (cdr `(1 2 3))
    (me (rest `(1 2 3))) => (cdr `(1 2 3))
    (caar `((1 2 3) 2 3)) => 1
    (cdar `((1 2 3) 2 3)) => (2 3)
    (cadr `(1 (1 2 3) 2 3)) => (1 2 3)
    (cddr `(1 2 3)) => (3)
    
The final 4 shortcuts above show how the names 'car' and 'cdr' can be
combined into terse, longer combinations to allow for selection into
more complex list structures.

Spend some time to fully understand what is happening here when these
macros are defined and run.

Exercise: write 'fourth', and 'fifth'.

    (fourth `(1 2 3 4 5 6)) => 4
    (fifth `(1 2 3 4 5 6)) => 5


1) if - tradional conditional
-----------------------------

cond is a general purpose conditional, but sometimes it can be clearer
to use more a traditional conditional construct known as 'if'.  It
takes a test, evaluates it and if it is true, runs the second
statement, and when not, it runs the second statement.

(defmacro if (test true false)
  `(cond
     (,test ,true) ; check test, evaulate true if not ()
     (t ,false)))  ; else, evaluate false
    
Examples: 

    (if t 1 2) => 1
    (if () 1 2) => 2
    (if (eq t t) 1 2) => 1
    (if (eq t ()) 1 2) => 2


2) when - single branch conditional
-----------------------------------

Sometimes you don't need both branches of an if statement and just
want to perform and action when the test is true.  This is when you
use when.  This macro makes use of &body in the argument list, which
means to take all of the arguments following as a list and bind them
to the variable name following &body in the arugument list.

(defmacro when (test &body body)
  `(cond
     (,test ,@body)))

Examples: 

    (when t 1) => 1
    (when () 1) => ()
    (when (eq t t) 1) => 1
    (when (eq t ()) 1) => ()


3) reverse - reverse a list
---------------------------

Reverse a list by building a new list in opposite order using
cons'ing.  Building a list this way is an important idiom to
understand, and thanfully this function is quite simple because the
lists built using cons'ing are in 'reverse' order, that is, items are
added to the front rather than the back of the list.

(defmacro reverse (l)
  `((lambda (l2 a) ; an anonymous function
      (if l2 ; if l2 is not null
          (self (cdr l2) (cons (car l2) a)) ; recurse
          a)) ; else return a, the accumlator
    ,l ())) ; call the anonymous function immediately

Examples: 

    (reverse `(1 2 3)) => (3 2 1)
    (reverse `((1 2 3) a b c)) => (c b a (1 2 3))

Exercises:

    1. Will reverse work with improper lists?  Why not?


4) map - build a list by running a function over another list
-------------------------------------------------------------

'map' is what is known as a higher order function, that is, one which
takes a function as an argument.  In this case the function given is
'run over' the second argument, a list. The function is called with
every element of the list, and a new list is built using the results.

(defmacro map (f l)
  `((lambda (l2 a) ; delcare an anonymous function
      (if l2 ; if l2 is not null
          (self (cdr l2) (cons (,f (car l2)) a)) ; recurse
          (reverse a))) ; return the accumlator, reversed
    ,l ())) ; call the anonymous function, evaulating l
            ; and passing () for a

Examples:

    (map (lambda (x) (+ x x)) `(1 2 3)) => (2 4 6)
    (map car `((1 a) (2 b) (3 c))) => (1 2 3)
    (map second `((1 a) (2 b) (3 c))) => (a b c)

Exercises:

    1. Write a map statement that takes a list `(1 2 3) and
       returns `(3 6 9).

5) ls - show the current environment
------------------------------------

'env' is a useful function but it's output can be a bit verbose.  'ls'
is a macro that returns you just the variables that are defined in the
environment but not their values, making for less output to that you
have to parse mentally.

(defmacro ls ()
  `(map car (env)))

Examples:

    (ls) => (t nil)
    (set `x 1) => 1
    (ls) => (t nil x)

5) lsf - show the current function environment
----------------------------------------------

Like 'ls', but shows the names of the functions and macros that have
been defined.

(defmacro lsf ()
  `(map car (fenv)))

Examples:

    (lsf) => (atom null ...  ls lsf)
    (defmacro f (x) x) => (macro (x) x)
    (lsf) => (atom null ... lsf f)

6) let - declare local variables
--------------------------------

Often you need to use additional temporary variables when performing a
computation. 'let' can be used to create these temporaries, cleaning
them up after the body of the form is completed, returning the value
of the last executed statement.

(defmacro let (args &body body)
  ((lambda (vars values) ; notice! we are processing the arguments to let
     `((lambda ,vars ,@body) ,@args)) ; notice! this is the code that
                                      ; is returned by let
     (map car args) ; argument 1 above, vars
     (map cadr args))) ; argument 2 above, values

Examples:

    (map car `((a 1) (b 2))) => (a b) ; like vars, above
    (map cadr `((a 1) (b 2))) => (1 2) ; like values, above
    (let ((a 1) (b 2)) (+ a b)) => 3
    a => ; error, undefined symbol
    b => ; error, undefined symbol

7) aif - anamorphic if
----------------------

Since () is always false and anything else is true, sometimes we may
want to know the value that is returned by the test that is passed to
'if'.  This can be done by saving the value in the environment for the
body of the 'if', which we are going to call 'it'.  You can then
reference the value of 'it' anywhere in the body of the 'if' statement.

(defmacro aif (test true false)
  `(let ((it ,test))
     (if it ,true ,false)))

Examples:

    (aif 1 it ()) => 1
    (aif (car `(1 2 3)) it 2) => 1
    (aif (car `(() 2 3)) it 2) => 2

Note: the injection of variables that can be used in the body of a
macro makes the macro 'anamorphic'.  For a further explanation of this
concept, see "On Lisp", chapter 14.

8) awhen - anamorphic when
--------------------------

Like 'aif', but with when.

(defmacro awhen (test &body body)
  `(let ((it ,test))
     (when it ,@body)))

Examples:

    (awhen 1 it) => 1
    (awhen () it) => () ; notice! awhen by default returns ()


9) last - return the last element of a list
-------------------------------------------

Sometimes you want the last element of the list. This function shows
recursing down a list until it reaches the end, when it return the
last element.

(defmacro last (l)
  `((lambda (l)
      (if (cdr l)
          (self (cdr l))
          (car l))))
  ,l))

Examples:

    (last `(1 2 3)) => 3


10) length - return the length of a list
----------------------------------------

Knowing the length of a list is generally very useful during
computations.  Here is a macro that recursively computes it given a
list using an accumulator.

(defmacro length (l)
  `((lambda (l n)
      (if l
          (self (cdr l) (+ n 1))
          n))
    ,l 0))

Examples:

    (length ()) => 0
    (length `(1 2 3)) => 3
    (length `((1 2 3) a b c)) => 4


11) nth - return the nth element of a list
------------------------------------------

Although macros like 'first', 'second' and 'third' are useful, you
often want a general purpose way of getting a certain element from a
list.  'nth' is designed to perform that operation, given a list and
an integer.

(defmacro nth (n l)
  `((lambda (n l)
      (if (eq n 0)
          (car l)
          (self (- n 1) (cdr l)))) ,n ,l))

Examples:

    (nth 0 `(1 2 3)) => 1
    (nth 1 `(1 2 3)) => 2
    (nth 2 `(1 2 3)) => 3


12) not - logical compliment
----------------------------

When using boolean values, sometimes you want the opposite of the
value you have. In this case you use 'not', which returns the
compliment of any value, logically.

(defmacro not (x)
  `((lambda (v)
      (cond
        ((null v) t) ; check for (), if so, return t
        (t ()))) ; else return () for everything else
    ,x)) ; evaulate the argument x

Examples:

    (not ()) => t
    (not t) => ()
    (not 1) => ()


13) unless - negative single branch conditional
----------------------------------------------

Like when, but the logical opposite. It runs its body of when its test
returns ().

(defmacro unless (test &body body)
  `(cond ((not ,test) ,@body)))

Examples:

    (unless t 1) => ()
    (unless () 1) => 1
    (unless (eq t t) 1) => ()
    (unless (eq t ()) 1) => 1


14) and - logical and
---------------------

'and' is another boolean function, one that returns true when all of
its parameters are true.  Because of this property, if any of the
values that it is passed returns false, you can assume the final value
is false, so you can stop evaluating the arguments and just return
false.  This behaviour is called 'short circuiting' and will be very
useful in the future.

(defmacro and (&rest args)
  `((lambda (args) ; an anonymous function
      (if args ; if args is not ()
          (if (eval (car args)) ; evaluate the argument
              (self (cdr args)) ; if true, continue with other args
              ()) ; evaluation returned false, so and is false
          t)) ; all evaluated args returned true, so return true
    `,args)) ; call anonymous function with args quoted,
             ; as we are evaluating them individually above

Examples:

    (and () ()) => ()
    (and () t) => ()
    (and t ()) => ()
    (and t t) => t
    (and 1 1) => t
    (and () (set `a 1)) => ()
    a => ; error, undefined variable,
         ; set was not run due to short circuiting

15) or - logicial or
--------------------

Similar to and, or returns true if any of its arguments are true.  We
can also take advantage of this and 'short ciruit' on this behaviour
as well.

(defmacro or (&rest args)
  `((lambda (args)
      (if args
          (if (eval (car args))
              t
              (self (cdr args)))
          ())) `,args))

Examples:

    (or () ()) => ()
    (or () t) => t
    (or t ()) => t
    (or t t) => t
    (or 1 1) => t
    (or t (set `a 1)) => ()
    a => ; error, undefined variable, 
         ; set was not run due to short circuiting

16) xor - logical exclusive or
------------------------------

Similar to 'and' and 'or', 'xor' returns true if one or the other of
its arguments is true.  You will notice that we are use 'let' to hold
the value of our evaluated arguments.  You generally only want to
evaluate the arguments you are passed once. This is because the
evaluation of certain arguments may cause 'side effects', and
evaluating them more than once may cause unintended conciquences and
should be avoided.

(defmacro xor (x y)
  `(let ((xe ,x) ; evaluate x once
         (ye ,y)) ; evaluate y once
     (and
      (or xe ye)
      (not (and xe ye)))))

Examples:

    (xor () ()) => ()
    (xor t ()) => t
    (xor () t) => t
    (xor t t) => ()

17) list - create a proper list of all arguments
------------------------------------------------

Creating lists with cons can often be tedious, so lets define a macro
to make it easier.  This example shows how to use the underlying lisp
to build the list and evaluate the arguments.

(defmacro list (&rest rest)
  `((lambda (&rest rest)
     rest) ,@rest))

Examples:

    (list `a `b `c) => (a b c)
    (list 1 2 3) => (1 2 3)

;; WARNING: THE FOLLOWING CODE IS UNTESTED

18) equal - compare if two things are equal, including lists
------------------------------------------------------------

If you recall from the discussion of 'eq', it does not compare the
equality of lists, just atoms.  The following is a function that does
a 'deep' comparison between 2 items, including lists.

(defmacro equal (x y)
  `((lambda (a b)
      (cond
        ((and (atom a) (atom b)) (eq a b))
        ((and (null a) (null b)) t)
        ((or (null a) (null b)) ())
        (t
         (self (cdr a) (cdr b))))) ,x ,y))

Examples:

    (equal t t) => t
    (equal () ()) => t
    (equal 1 1) => t
    (equal `(1 2 3) `(1 2 3)) => t
    (equal `((1 2 3 (x y z)) a b c) `((1 2 3 (x y z)) a b c)) => t
    (equal `(1 2 3) `(1 2)) => ()
    (defmacro pallindromep (l)
      `(let ((le ,l))
         (equal le (reverse le))))
    (pallindromep `(1 2 3 4)) => ()
    (pallindromep `(1 2 3 4 3 2 1)) => t


19) member - see if something is in a list
------------------------------------------

(defmacro member (x l &rest test)
  `(let ((t (if ,test ,test eq)))
     (lambda (x l)
       (if l
           (if (t x (car l))
               l
               (self x (cdr l)))
           ())) ,x ,l))

Examples:

    (member 1 `(1 2 3)) => (1 2 3)
    (member 3 `(1 2 3)) => (3)
    (member 4 `(1 2 3)) => ()
    (member `(1 2 3) `(a b c (1 2 3))) => ()
    (member `(1 2 3) `(a b c (1 2 3)) equal) => ((1 2 3))  


21) filter - remove elements from a list based on a predicate
-------------------------------------------------------------

(defun filter (f l)
  `((lambda (l a)
      (if l
          (if (,f (car l))
              (self (cdr l) (cons (car l) a))
              (self (cdr l) a))
          (reverse a))) ,l))

Examples:

    (filter (lambda (x) (eq x 1)) `(1 2 3)) => (2 3)
    (filter (lambda (x) (or (eq x 1) (eq x 3)) `(1 2 3)) => (2)

            
22) rm - remove a symbol from the environment
---------------------------------------------

Examples:

    (set `x 1) => 1 ; define a symbol in the environment
    x => 1
    (rm `x) => 1 ; returns the old value of x
    x => ; Error, undefined symbol


23) rmf - remove a macro from the function environment
------------------------------------------------------

Examples:

    (defmacro double (x) `(+ ,x ,x)) => (macro (x) `(+ ,x ,x))
    (double 2) => 4
    (rmf `double) => (macro (x) `(+ ,x ,x))
    (double 2) => ; Error, undefined function


15) mapn - like map, but takes n lists as arguments
---------------------------------------------------

'mapn' is like 'map', in that it runs a function to create a new list,
but it can take multiple lists, and therefore, functions of multiple
arguments.  'mapn' iterates down the lists in parallel, calling the
function f with the first elements of each of the lists, after which
it recurses with the rest of the lists.  If you only have one list,
'map' is faster to use computationally, although 'mapn' will work with
a single list if needed.

;; Note: this doesn't work yet
(defmacro mapn (f &rest lists)
  `((lambda (xs a)
      (if xs
          (let ((heads (map car xs)))
            (self (cdr xs) (cons (eval `(,f ,@heads) a)))
        (reverse a)))
    `,lists ()))

Examples:

    (mapn (lambda (x y) (+ x y)) `(1 2 3) `(1 2 3)) => (2 4 6)
    (mapn (lambda (x y) (+ x y)) `(x y z) `(a b c) `(1 2 3)) => (xa1 yb2 zc3)

16) setq

(defmacro setq (&rest rest)
  (lambda (vars values)
    `(mapn (lambda (var value)
             (set var value)) ,vars ,values)
    (map car vars)
    (map cadr vars)))

Examples:

    (setq x 1) => 1
    x => 1
    (setq x 2 y 3) => 3
    x => 2
    y => 3
